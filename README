Auto-Cropper v0.1
=================

You will need Racket to run and/or compile this program. You can download it at
http://www.racket-lang.org

This program allows you to quickly crop multiple images in multiple ways. To
use it, select your input folder and output folder, then click "Begin". Left-
click and drag to unmask areas; right-click and drag to mask them. Click "Add
Mask" to add another mask to the same image, and use the left-hand list to
select an existing mask. When you're done, click "Next" to automatically save
the masked images and move on to the next image. Masked images are saved in
the format

    [XXXX]-[YY].png

where XXXX is the index of the image, and YY is the index of the mask.
